The client is DriverPass. They want a system that can prepare users for their driving test.
they wanted a cloud-based web system that could handle scheduking driving practice and  practice exams. 
the system would also need to in compliance with the DMV and regular oversight. 
they want secure user accounts with special permissions determined by each level. such as student, teacher and admin.
A web-portal accesible through most browsers and devices. 

I think i did well in cinsidering the security and accesibility of the system. such as using acloud interface foe scalability as the program grows. Also the secure login and protocols in case a user tries to login with brute force. 

I would revise my initial UML to be more clear and fix my namin conventions. With the practice Ive got a better grip of the use of lucid chart. Maybe even addinf a legend correctly labeled to calarify. most of my UML are simple and can be reworked into a more stream-linded design. 

I think the users needs and experience are ine of the most crucial pieces of design. eas of use is a common variable people look for. Especially with a saturated market. Especially if its confusing, users will avoid it altogether.

I approach designing software head on, thinking on who will use it. for driverpass the first thing i did was look at what the client wanted, then planned on what the system would need to complete this, such as the roles and specialized permission. In the I build quick drafts to flesh out the designs more, then ask for feedback more often.
